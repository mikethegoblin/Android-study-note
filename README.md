# Android-study-note
This is where I keep my study notes about android

I'm learning to write android apps through doing a series of codelabs that Google provides for Android beginners. I find these codelabs extremely helpful because they help me understand the basics of Android apps through creating simple practical apps. For those who are interested, here is the link to the [android codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/android-training/).

__Important Note__: this repo only contains study notes, not tutorials for android.
